Customizable design system using web components

### What are web components?

According to MDN,

```
Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom
elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize
them in your web apps.
```

In simple terms, it is one of many ways to create reusable UI elements. The main reason it is different from more mature design system is that it utilizes native html elements to achieve this. It does not matter if you have projects in react, vue, svelte or something new fancy framework. Web components will work similarly in all these frameworks with minor customization.

### Project Goals

- [ ] Basic UI components
- [ ] Option to install the dependecy and render components in different frameworks (react, vue, svelte, solid etc)
- [ ] Option to add style customization to UI components
